## sf R package

Package `sf` puts geometries in a list-column of class `sfc`, where each list element is a feature geometry of class `sfg`. 

#### Feature Geometries
Feature geometries are represented in R by

* a numeric vector for a single point (`POINT`)
* a numeric matrix (each row a point) for a set of points (`MULTIPOINT` or `LINESTRING`)
* a list of matrices for a set of set of points (`MULTIINESTRING`, `POLYGON`)
* a list of lists of matrices  (`MULTIPOLYGON`)
* a list of anything mentioned above  (`GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`)

(all other classes also fall in one of these categories)

Other tidy aspects of `sf`:

* all functions/methods start with `st_` (press tab to search), use `_` and underscores
* all function have data as first argument, "pipe-friendly"
* `read_sf` is an alias for `st_read` with tidy defaults: silent, `stringAsFactors = FALSE`
* many tidy verbs implemented as methods for `sf` objects (see further down)
